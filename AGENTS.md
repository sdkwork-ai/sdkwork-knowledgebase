# Repository Guidelines

<!-- SDKWORK-AGENTS-GENERATED: v2 -->

## SDKWORK Soul

Read `../sdkwork-specs/SOUL.md` before executing tasks in this root. Follow specs before memory, dictionary before context, stop on ambiguity, and evidence before completion.

## SDKWORK Standards

<!-- SDKWORK-PROGRESSIVE-LOADING: v1 -->
Resolve this standards root once and use it as the global authority for the current task:

- `../sdkwork-specs/README.md`
- `../sdkwork-specs/SOUL.md`
- `../sdkwork-specs/AGENTS_SPEC.md`

Read only the relevant README task-matrix row or navigation heading, then load the selected authority sections.
<!-- /SDKWORK-PROGRESSIVE-LOADING: v1 -->

Canonical SDKWORK specs path from this root:

- `../sdkwork-specs/README.md`
- `../sdkwork-specs/SOUL.md`
- `../sdkwork-specs/AGENTS_SPEC.md`
- `../sdkwork-specs/PNPM_SCRIPT_SPEC.md`
- `../sdkwork-specs/GITHUB_WORKFLOW_SPEC.md`
- `../sdkwork-specs/CODE_STYLE_SPEC.md`
- `../sdkwork-specs/NAMING_SPEC.md`

Do not copy root standard text into this repository. If these relative paths do not resolve, stop and report the broken workspace layout.

## Application Identity

Read `sdkwork.app.config.json` only when the task touches Knowledgebase application behavior, runtime config, SDK wiring, release metadata, app-owned capabilities, packaging, or deployment. For unrelated documentation or tooling work, do not expand into the full app manifest unless evidence requires it.

## Group Knowledgebase Boundary

This repository owns the Knowledgebase side of the group-knowledgebase
boundary declared in `../sdkwork-im/AGENTS.md` (Group Knowledgebase Boundary):

- `sdkwork-im` owns Conversation membership, current-Owner initialization
  authorization, lifecycle status, and opaque launch-ticket issuance.
- `sdkwork-knowledgebase` owns the one-to-one group-space binding, content,
  and final ACL enforcement.
- Browser launch consumes only the opaque ticket in the standalone
  Knowledgebase route fragment. Desktop launch consumes only that ticket
  through the registered deep link (`sdkwork-knowledgebase://group-launch/<opaque-ticket>`)
  to this product's Tauri process. Space identifiers, destinations, session
  tokens, and caller context are never accepted from IM URLs; the ticket is
  short-lived, single-use, hash-stored, and bound to actor/scope/version/epoch
  per `RPC_SPEC.md` section 13.2.
- Trusted IM integration uses generated IM SDKs and generated Knowledgebase
  RPC SDKs (`sdkwork-knowledgebase-rpc-sdk`) or approved composed facades
  only. Raw HTTP, manual credential headers, and local SDK forks are
  forbidden; the trusted RPC path requires mTLS, signed caller context, and
  deployment readiness described in `etc/topology/README.md`.

## Local Dictionary Structure

- `AGENTS.md`: repository agent entrypoint and relative SDKWork spec index.
- `CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md`, `CODEX.md`: compatibility shims that point to `AGENTS.md` and must not duplicate rules.
- `sdkwork.app.config.json`: Knowledgebase application identity, runtime, release, and capability metadata.
- `etc/`: deployable-root source configuration for concrete environment, Base URL, bind, topology, and deployment values.
- `sdkwork.workflow.json`: GitHub packaging/release workflow manifest governed by `GITHUB_WORKFLOW_SPEC.md`.
- `.github/workflows/package.yml`: thin reusable workflow call only.
- `.sdkwork/`: repository/application AI workspace metadata, local skills, local plugins, and manifests.
- `specs/`: local application/component contracts and narrowing rules.
- `apis/`: Knowledgebase-owned API contract sources and materialized OpenAPI inputs.
- `apps/`: runnable Knowledgebase application roots and application surfaces.
- `crates/`: reusable Rust crates and route/runtime crates.
- `sdks/`: SDK families, SDK generation manifests, composed facades, and generated SDK artifacts.
- `deployments/`, `scripts/`, `tools/`, `docs/`, `tests/`: deployment descriptors, thin command entrypoints, validators, documentation, and verification assets; source configuration is owned only by `etc/`.
- `package.json`, `Cargo.toml`: language/build manifests.

## Spec Resolution Order

<!-- SDKWORK-PROGRESSIVE-LOADING: v1 -->
Use dynamic progressive loading for the current task: resolve the selected root and task category before reading broad source context.

1. Read this `AGENTS.md` routing material and classify the owned surface.
2. Read `sdkwork.app.config.json`, module `specs/`, repository/application `specs/`, and `.sdkwork/` only when the task reaches the contract each item governs.
3. Locate only the relevant task-matrix row or navigation heading in `../sdkwork-specs/README.md`; do not load the full catalog.
4. Read only the task-specific global spec sections selected by that route, then inspect implementation files.
<!-- /SDKWORK-PROGRESSIVE-LOADING: v1 -->

Use dynamic progressive loading:

1. Read this `AGENTS.md` and any nearer component-level `AGENTS.md`.
2. Read `sdkwork.app.config.json` only when app behavior, runtime config, SDK wiring, release, packaging, or app-owned capabilities are touched.
3. Read local `specs/README.md` and `specs/component.spec.json` only when the task touches that local contract.
4. Read local `.sdkwork/README.md`, `.sdkwork/skills/`, and `.sdkwork/plugins/` only when local agent extensions are relevant.
5. Read `../sdkwork-specs/README.md`, then only the task-specific root specs.
6. Inspect implementation files after the dictionary and relevant specs are clear.

Do not load the whole repository or every root spec before identifying the task surface.

## Required Specs By Task Type

- Agent/workflow changes: `../sdkwork-specs/SOUL.md`, `../sdkwork-specs/AGENTS_SPEC.md`, `../sdkwork-specs/SDKWORK_WORKSPACE_SPEC.md`, `../sdkwork-specs/GITHUB_WORKFLOW_SPEC.md`, and `../sdkwork-specs/TEST_SPEC.md`.
- Package script changes: `../sdkwork-specs/PNPM_SCRIPT_SPEC.md`, `../sdkwork-specs/APP_RUNTIME_TOPOLOGY_SPEC.md`, `../sdkwork-specs/CONFIG_SPEC.md`, and `../sdkwork-specs/TEST_SPEC.md`.
- Any code change: `../sdkwork-specs/CODE_STYLE_SPEC.md`, `../sdkwork-specs/NAMING_SPEC.md`, plus only the touched language/framework spec.
- Rust code: `../sdkwork-specs/RUST_CODE_SPEC.md`; add `../sdkwork-specs/RUST_RPC_SPEC.md` when RPC is touched.
- Java/Spring code: `../sdkwork-specs/JAVA_CODE_SPEC.md` and `../sdkwork-specs/WEB_BACKEND_SPEC.md` when HTTP backend behavior is touched.
- TypeScript/Node code: `../sdkwork-specs/TYPESCRIPT_CODE_SPEC.md`.
- Frontend/UI code: `../sdkwork-specs/FRONTEND_CODE_SPEC.md`, `../sdkwork-specs/FRONTEND_SPEC.md`, `../sdkwork-specs/UI_ARCHITECTURE_SPEC.md`, and exactly one detailed UI architecture spec.
- API/SDK changes: `../sdkwork-specs/API_SPEC.md`, `../sdkwork-specs/WEB_FRAMEWORK_SPEC.md`, `../sdkwork-specs/WEB_BACKEND_SPEC.md`, `../sdkwork-specs/SDK_SPEC.md`, `../sdkwork-specs/SDK_WORKSPACE_GENERATION_SPEC.md`, and `../sdkwork-specs/TEST_SPEC.md`.
- Runtime/deployment/release changes: `../sdkwork-specs/CONFIG_SPEC.md`, `../sdkwork-specs/ENVIRONMENT_SPEC.md`, `../sdkwork-specs/DEPLOYMENT_SPEC.md`, `../sdkwork-specs/RELEASE_SPEC.md`, `../sdkwork-specs/SUPPLY_CHAIN_SECURITY_SPEC.md`, and `../sdkwork-specs/GITHUB_WORKFLOW_SPEC.md`.
- Security/auth changes: `../sdkwork-specs/IAM_SPEC.md`, `../sdkwork-specs/IAM_LOGIN_INTEGRATION_SPEC.md`, `../sdkwork-specs/SECURITY_SPEC.md`, and `../sdkwork-specs/PRIVACY_SPEC.md`.

Language-specific specs are on-demand; do not load Rust, Java, TypeScript, and frontend specs for unrelated tasks.

## Int64 Wire Contract (API_SPEC §13.6)

- OpenAPI `int64` fields and parameters `MUST` be `type: string`, `format: int64`,
  a decimal `pattern` such as `^-?[0-9]+$`, and `x-sdkwork-int64-string: true`.
  `type: integer, format: int64` is a contract violation: generated TypeScript
  SDKs then emit `number`, and browsers silently round ids past
  `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER` (2^53), replaying wrong ids into lookups.
- Rust response DTOs `MUST` serialize `i64` wire fields with
  `#[serde(with = "sdkwork_utils_rust::serde_int64")]` (or `::option`); request
  boundaries parse inbound strings with the same helper.
- Generated TypeScript SDKs keep `int64` as `string`; frontend code `MUST NOT`
  convert ids/snowflake ids/sequence ids to `number` for storage, comparison,
  or submission.
- Verification: `node <sdkwork-specs>/tools/check-api-operation-patterns.mjs --workspace .`

## Code Style Rules

Read `../sdkwork-specs/CODE_STYLE_SPEC.md` and `../sdkwork-specs/NAMING_SPEC.md` before code changes. Keep edits inside the owning module, package, crate, app root, or standard tool. Generated SDK transport output is changed only through source contracts, generator inputs, or approved composed facades. Use `sdkwork-utils-rust` / `@sdkwork/utils` and `sdkwork-id-core` for shared generic helpers instead of duplicating utility logic locally.

Build scripts, dev runners, and `pnpm clean` must follow `CODE_STYLE_SPEC.md` §7 (Build Source Integrity And Self-Healing). Git-tracked build-critical source files must be verified before builds and self-healed from git when missing; `clean` must not delete them.

## Build, Test, and Verification

<!-- SDKWORK-VERIFICATION-ROUTING: v1 -->
Choose only the narrowest verification selected by the changed surface. This is not a default full-suite command list.
Run workspace-wide checks only when the change crosses that boundary.
`bootstrap-*`, `align-*`, `sync-*`, `--write`, and other mutating repair commands are not verification defaults; use them only for an explicitly scoped repair, migration, bootstrap, or alignment task and inspect the resulting diff.
<!-- /SDKWORK-VERIFICATION-ROUTING: v1 -->

Use canonical root package scripts from `PNPM_SCRIPT_SPEC.md`:

- `pnpm dev`: default PostgreSQL, `standalone` browser dev workflow.
- `pnpm dev:browser` and `pnpm dev:desktop`: same PostgreSQL standalone defaults for development orchestration.
- Application server development profiles use PostgreSQL; this root exposes no SQLite server alias.
- `pnpm build`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm check`, `pnpm verify`, `pnpm clean`: standard root lifecycle commands.
- `pnpm check:pnpm-script-standard`: validate package script standardization.
- `pnpm check:agent-workflow-standard`: validate AGENTS and GitHub packaging workflow standardization.

Run the narrowest relevant check first, then broader verification when API contracts, SDK generation, persistence, security, packaging, or cross-package boundaries change.

## Agent Execution Rules

<!-- SDKWORK-PROGRESSIVE-LOADING: v1 -->
Use dynamic progressive loading for the current task; treat indexes and cross-references as discovery, not as a startup bundle.
Keep `../sdkwork-specs/SOUL.md` and the task-selected standards authoritative; expand context only when evidence exposes a new contract boundary.
Language-specific specs are on-demand: only the touched language loads `../sdkwork-specs/RUST_CODE_SPEC.md`, `../sdkwork-specs/JAVA_CODE_SPEC.md`, `../sdkwork-specs/TYPESCRIPT_CODE_SPEC.md`, or `../sdkwork-specs/FRONTEND_CODE_SPEC.md`.
Package command standardization loads `../sdkwork-specs/PNPM_SCRIPT_SPEC.md` only when the current task changes package commands or scripts; GitHub packaging work loads `../sdkwork-specs/GITHUB_WORKFLOW_SPEC.md` only when it reaches that workflow boundary.
Do not infer a recursive workspace scan or a broad validation suite from the presence of a path alone.
<!-- /SDKWORK-PROGRESSIVE-LOADING: v1 -->

Use the convention dictionary before broad source loading. Follow dynamic progressive loading: nearest AGENTS, relevant manifests/specs, task-specific root standards, then implementation. Do not preserve legacy aliases or local guidance blocks when root SDKWork standards already govern the behavior. Do not replace generated SDK integration with raw HTTP. Record exact verification commands and important outputs before reporting completion.

## Task-Specific Standards

API work loads `../sdkwork-specs/API_SPEC.md` and its validators. List/search work loads `../sdkwork-specs/PAGINATION_SPEC.md` and `check-pagination.mjs`. Source configuration work loads `../sdkwork-specs/SOURCE_CONFIG_SPEC.md` and `check-source-config-standard.mjs`. Link these authorities instead of copying their normative bodies into `AGENTS.md`.

## Human Review Rules

Request human review before breaking SDKWork standards, changing public naming, altering security/auth behavior, changing database migrations or production deployment config, deleting data/files, changing generated SDK ownership, or modifying release/deployment governance. Surface unresolved spec paths, app identity conflicts, component ownership conflicts, and API authority ambiguity instead of guessing.
